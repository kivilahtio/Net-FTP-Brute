Net-FTP-Brute

Tries it's best to establish a connection to a ftp-server.
If cannot connect, retries tirelessly for network to come back up.
If can connect, but cannot establish a DATA-connection, starts
brute forcing with parallel ftp-connections to find an open port.

You should use ftp in passive mode for brute-forcing to work best.
